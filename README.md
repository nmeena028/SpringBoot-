# SpringBoot-

# User and Employee Management System

This is a Spring Boot application that provides a user and employee management interface. It allows users to manage employee records, such as adding, updating, deleting, and viewing employees. The project uses the H2 database for storing data and the Spring Boot framework to build a robust and scalable backend.

## Features

- **User Management**: Create, update, and view users.
- **Employee Management**: Add, update, and view employee details.
- **H2 Database**: In-memory database for storing user and employee data.
- **Spring Boot Framework**: Provides a fast and secure backend structure.

## Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot**: For building the backend API and server.
- **H2 Database**: An in-memory database for easy testing and storage.
- **Java**: The programming language used to implement the backend logic.
- **Spring Data JPA**: For database interactions using Java Persistence API (JPA).
- **Thymeleaf** (optional, if your project has a UI): For rendering dynamic HTML views (if applicable).
